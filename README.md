# **HR-Analytics-using-Tableau**

## **Project Overview:**

This project focuses on HR analytics, leveraging a comprehensive dataset to analyze employee dynamics, satisfaction, performance, and retention patterns. Using Tableau as a data visualization tool, the project explores the relationships between key HR metrics such as attrition, job satisfaction, performance ratings, business travel frequency, work-life balance, and employee demographics. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, this project aims to help HR professionals make data-driven decisions to optimize employee engagement, improve retention strategies, and enhance overall workforce management.

## **Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to use HR data to:

- **Analyze Employee Attrition:** Understand the factors contributing to employee attrition and retention across various demographics, departments, and job roles.
- **Evaluate Employee Engagement:** Assess job satisfaction, performance, and work-life balance to identify drivers of employee engagement.
- **Predict Retention Risks:** Identify patterns and potential risks related to employee retention based on historical data.
- **Optimize HR Strategies:** Provide HR professionals with insights to design more effective recruitment, training, and retention strategies.
- **Provide Actionable Insights:** Generate visualizations and dashboards that HR teams can use for decision-making.

The goal is to turn raw HR data into actionable insights to drive employee retention, satisfaction, and productivity, which are essential to a company's success.

## **About the Data:**

The dataset consists of a range of attributes related to employees, including their demographic details, job characteristics, work environment factors, and performance indicators. The key attributes in the dataset are:

- **Attrition:** Whether an employee has left the company or is still working (Current or Ex-Employees).
- **Business Travel:** Frequency of business travel (Rarely, Frequently).
- **Age Band:** The employeeâ€™s age range (e.g., 25-34, 35-44, Over 55).
- **Department:** The department the employee works in (e.g., Sales, R&D).
- **Job Role:** Specific job position (e.g., Sales Executive, Research Scientist).
- **Job Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Work-Life Balance:** Metrics assessing employee satisfaction and engagement levels.
- **Performance Rating:** Employee performance score.
- **Marital Status, Gender, and Education:** Demographic data including marital status, gender, and education level.
- **Training Times Last Year:** Number of training sessions attended by the employee.
- **Employee Number:** Unique identifier for each employee.
- **Over Time:** Whether the employee works overtime (Yes/No).
- **Years at Company, Years in Current Role:** Tenure-related data.

This rich dataset allows for multi-dimensional analysis to uncover hidden trends, patterns, and insights across various employee attributes.

## **Methodology:**

- **Data Import and Preprocessing:** The dataset was imported into Tableau, where I cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Marital Status).
- **Calculated Fields:** Created custom calculated fields such as Attrition Rate, Work Experience Band, and Salary Distribution to derive key metrics and segment data for deeper insights.
- **Objective-Specific Visualizations:**
- **Attrition:** Visualized attrition by department, age, and job role using bar charts and heat maps.
- **Employee Engagement:** Created scatter plots and box plots to assess job satisfaction and work-life balance.
- **Demographics:** Used pie charts and histograms to show employee distribution by gender, education, and business travel.
- **Training:** Displayed trends in training times using line graphs and bar charts.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Integrated all visualizations into interactive dashboards with filters and drill-downs, allowing HR professionals to explore the data and derive actionable insights efficiently.

## **Results:**
The analysis provided key insights to improve HR strategies:

- **Attrition Insights:** Higher attrition rates were observed in employees aged 25-44 and in roles like Laboratory Technicians. Low job satisfaction and work-life balance were major factors influencing attrition.
- **Business Travel & Engagement:** Frequent business travelers showed higher dissatisfaction with work-life balance, suggesting burnout risks. A balanced approach to travel and workload could improve retention.
- **Employee Performance & Retention:** High performance ratings correlated with better job satisfaction and lower attrition. Employees engaged in more training programs were less likely to leave, emphasizing the importance of professional development.
- **Demographic Trends:** Younger employees and those with less tenure were more likely to leave, highlighting the need for targeted retention strategies for early-career staff.

## **Actionable Recommendations:**

- Implement targeted retention programs for high-risk groups (e.g., younger employees, those with low satisfaction).
- Increase training opportunities to enhance engagement and reduce attrition.
- Review work-life balance policies for frequent travelers and overtime workers to prevent burnout.
